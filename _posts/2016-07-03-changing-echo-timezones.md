## Using Amazon Echo outside the US

I've had the privilege of using all the devices in the Amazon Echo family for a while now, and one of the most frustrating things about non-US support was that the time on the device was wrong.

One simple solution is to set the ZIP code to 96799. This sets the time exactly 12 hours behind, so at least when you ask for the time it's 'correct' to a 12 hour clock. The issue I had with this method was Alarms - I had to keep remembering to set my morning alarms for the evening - something I forgot to do a couple of times!

Thankfully, it's possible to set the timezone of the device to anything using just a web browser and a few simple steps. Check out the video for a full walkthrough.

Note: this was tested around July 2016 and worked. I'm sure Amazon will update this at some point and it may stop working.
