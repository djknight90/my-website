title: Moving to Jekyll!

This is just a placeholder post.

I used to have a Wordpress hosted blog, but it was time to move to something easier to manage, so I ended up using Jekyll. Jekyll is an awesome static site generator written in Ruby. This blog is hosted on an AWS S3 bucket, so there is no server to manage and it costs around Â£0.50 a month to run, much cheaper than my old shared hosting package.

I'm in the process of extracting any old content and putting it up here, so keep an eye out for posts new and old over the coming weeks and months.
