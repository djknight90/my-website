This is just a placeholder post.

I used to have a Wordpress hosted blog, but it was time to move to something easier to manage, so I ended up using Jekyll. Jekyll is an awesomes static site generator written in Ruby.

1. You can also do cool things like highlight code, such as JS:
{% highlight javascript %}
var dom = document.getElementById('boom')
console.log(dom);
{% endhighlight %}

Or use other languages
